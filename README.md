# Cryptocurrency Clustering with K-means and PCA 

This script takes cryptocurrency market data, scales the data, applies the K-means algorithm to find clusters of similar cryptocurrencies, and then visualizes the results. It also optimizes the clusters using Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

## Setup and Data Load

First, the necessary libraries and dependencies are imported, including pandas, hvplot, KMeans, PCA, and StandardScaler. The cryptocurrency market data is then loaded into a DataFrame from a CSV file and some initial exploration is done.

## Data Preprocessing

Next, the data is scaled using the StandardScaler from scikit-learn to normalize it. This is an important step as it brings all variables to a similar scale which is especially required for distance-based algorithms like K-means. This transformed data is stored in a new DataFrame.

## Determining Optimal Clusters

The script uses the elbow method to find the optimal number of clusters for the K-means algorithm. This involves running K-means for a range of values of `k` (the number of clusters), and for each value of `k`, calculating the inertia (sum of squared distances of samples to their closest cluster center). The "elbow" in the plot of inertia versus `k` represents the best value for `k`, which in this case, is determined to be 4.

## Applying K-means Clustering

Using `k=4`, K-means is applied to the scaled data to predict the clusters for each cryptocurrency. A scatter plot is created to visualize the clusters, with the axes representing the 24-hour and 7-day price change percentages.

## Optimization with Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

To further optimize the clustering, PCA is applied to the data to reduce the dimensionality. PCA is a method that brings together highly correlated variables into a smaller set of representative features called components. This can help to simplify the dataset and improve the performance of the clustering algorithm. The first three principal components are used in this script.

Again, the elbow method is used to find the optimal `k` for the PCA-transformed data. Then, K-means clustering is applied to this PCA-transformed data, and a scatter plot of the PCA components is created to visualize the clusters.

## Visualizing and Comparing the Results

Finally, the script visualizes and compares the clustering results from the original and PCA-transformed data. This includes plots of the elbow curves and scatter plots of the clusters. From this visualization, it can be seen that the clustering makes more sense when the dimensions have been reduced by PCA.

## Conclusions

This script shows how K-means clustering can be used to identify clusters of cryptocurrencies based on their market data, and how PCA can be used to improve the results of the clustering. It can serve as a basis for further analysis of cryptocurrency market data, including identifying patterns and trends, and making predictions about future market movements.
